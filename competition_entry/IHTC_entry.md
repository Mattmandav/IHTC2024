# Method 

## Overview
We first generate an initial Feasible Solution using a greedy heuristic. With the remaining clock time, we run an iterative hyper-heuristic procedure consisting of a move selection and move acceptance step. The move portion is parellelised, allowing for up to 4 different move evaluations for each iteration step. The algorithm is described more formally below.
