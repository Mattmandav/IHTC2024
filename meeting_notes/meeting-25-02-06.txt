ACTIONS

Adam
- Worked out to hook up Q-learning
- Q-learning seems to still be worse than random
- Has a decaying learning rate
- Allow solutions to be infeasible for Q-learning to be better
- Monte-carlo


Ben
- C++ wrapper for solution checking
- Plan repo structure


Matt
- Move design
- Coordinating the spliting of repo into sections
- Make develop branch (?)


Graham
- Move design
- Solution analysis


Rebecca
- Population of not all the same
- Looked at doing record-to-record
- Look at "size" of solutions and impact on record-to-record (deterministic)
- Investigate simulated annealing (less tuning but random)


GENERAL TASKS TO THINK ABOUT
- Vote on day/afternoon/morning to do problem solving style session
- 15th February to 22nd February 2025
